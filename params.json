Currently Dreda supports 4 dimensions (x,y,z, and color). Color assignments are chosen randomly. \r\n\r\nI had been doing some visualizations in iPython and they left much to be desired. The data input here is just the ouput of a pandas data frame `to_json()` - a JSON object with an inner object for each column - index and value pairs in each inner object\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"x\":\r\n  {\r\n    \"0\":117.0501353217,\r\n    \"1\":63.4789054268,\r\n    \"2\":-92.4110611211\r\n  },\r\n  \"y\":\r\n    {\r\n      \"0\":-33.8277679817,\r\n      \"1\":120.3959209587,\r\n      \"2\":172.3790645372\r\n    },\r\n  \"z\":\r\n    {\r\n    \"0\":-17.441790351,\r\n    \"1\":-34.4737315608,\r\n    \"2\":-224.6172323059\r\n    },\r\n  \"cid\":\r\n    {\r\n      \"0\":4.0,\r\n      \"1\":1.0,\r\n      \"2\":4.0\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n# How\r\n\r\nClone, run `python -m SimpleHTTPSever`, and open `localhost:8000` in your browser.  \r\nOpen the console, and run the function `plotData()`. \r\n\r\n## Authors \r\n\r\n* Xander Johnson\r\n\r\n## License\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
